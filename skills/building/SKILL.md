# Building

*Clear the trail one checkpoint at a time.*

## Overview

Building wraps `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` or `superpowers:executing-plans` (GREEN phase). You implement minimal code to pass each failing test, respecting dependency order. Task files enforce what can be worked on.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the pathfinder:building skill to implement checkpoints."

## Prerequisites

- `.pathfinder/state.json` exists with `phases.scout.status === "complete"`
- All task files have `status: "red"` (tests written and failing)
- Scout gate exists: `.pathfinder/scout.json`

<HARD-GATE>
If scouting is not complete, REFUSE to build. Invoke pathfinder:scouting first.
Do NOT modify test files during building (unless fixing a genuine test bug, documented in builderNotes).
</HARD-GATE>

## The Process

### Step 1: Check Dependencies

Before working on ANY checkpoint:

```bash
bash scripts/pathfinder-check-deps.sh FEAT-01
```

If blocked, skip to the next unblocked checkpoint. Report which are blocked and why.

### Step 2: Build ONE Checkpoint at a Time

For each unblocked checkpoint, follow this strict loop:

1. **Read the task file** to understand what this checkpoint requires
2. **Run the failing test** to see the current error:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --grep "FEAT-01" --reporter=list
   npx vitest run --testNamePattern "FEAT-01"
   ```
3. **Write minimal implementation code** to make the test pass
4. **Run the test again** to verify it passes:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --grep "FEAT-01" --reporter=list
   npx vitest run --testNamePattern "FEAT-01"
   ```
5. **Run the full suite** to check for regressions:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --reporter=list
   npx vitest run
   ```

### Step 3: Update Task File

After the checkpoint's tests pass:

```python
import json, datetime
task = json.load(open('.pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json'))
task['status'] = 'green'
task['evidence']['green'] = {
    'e2e': 'PASS e2e/feature.spec.ts > FEAT-01 (1.2s)',
    'unit': 'PASS src/utils/feature.test.ts > FEAT-01 (3ms)',
    'fullSuite': 'Tests: N passed, 0 failed',
    'timestamp': datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'
}
task['builderNotes'] = '<brief note on implementation approach>'
json.dump(task, open('.pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json', 'w'), indent=2)
```

### Step 4: Commit

```bash
git add src/ .pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json
git commit -m "Builder: Clear FEAT-01"
```

### Step 5: Repeat for All Checkpoints

Continue in dependency order until all checkpoints are `green`.

### Step 6: Create Build Gate

After ALL checkpoints are green:

```bash
cat > .pathfinder/build.json << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>",
  "expedition": "<expedition-name>",
  "checkpointsCleared": <number>,
  "fullSuiteResult": "Tests: N passed, 0 failed"
}
EOF
```

### Step 7: Update State

```bash
bash scripts/pathfinder-update-state.sh
```

Then:

```python
import json
state = json.load(open('.pathfinder/state.json'))
state['currentPhase'] = 'build'
state['phases']['build'] = {'status': 'complete', 'timestamp': '<ISO-8601>'}
json.dump(state, open('.pathfinder/state.json', 'w'), indent=2)
```

### Step 8: Commit and Transition

```bash
git add .pathfinder/
git commit -m "Builder: All N checkpoints cleared (GREEN)"
```

Announce: "Build complete. All N checkpoints passing. Ready for reporting — invoke `pathfinder:reporting` or say `/report`."

## Subagent Dispatch (for large expeditions)

For expeditions with 5+ checkpoints, use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`:

Dispatch one subagent per checkpoint with this template:

```
You are a BUILDER for checkpoint FEAT-01 in a Pathfinder expedition.

TASK: <checkpoint description>

BEFORE YOU START:
1. Run: bash scripts/pathfinder-check-deps.sh FEAT-01
2. If blocked, report back immediately — do NOT proceed.

BUILD LOOP:
1. Run failing test: <test command>
2. Write minimal code to pass it
3. Run test again — must PASS
4. Run full suite — must not regress
5. Update .pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json (status→green, evidence)
6. Commit: "Builder: Clear FEAT-01"

Do NOT modify test files. Do NOT work on other checkpoints.
```

After each subagent completes, review with `superpowers:requesting-code-review`.

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Building checkpoints out of dependency order | Always check deps first |
| Writing more code than needed to pass tests | Minimal implementation only |
| Modifying tests to make them pass | Fix implementation, not tests |
| Skipping the full suite check | Regressions compound — catch them early |
| Claiming "tests pass" without running them | Capture actual test output as evidence |
| Working on multiple checkpoints simultaneously | One at a time, commit each |

## Output

- Implementation code for all checkpoints
- `.pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-XX.json` — all updated to `status: "green"` with evidence
- `.pathfinder/build.json` — gate file
- Updated `.pathfinder/state.json`
