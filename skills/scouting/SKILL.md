# Scouting

*Mark the trail with failing tests before anyone builds.*

## Overview

Scouting wraps `superpowers:test-driven-development` (RED phase only). You write failing tests for every planned checkpoint and capture the failure evidence in task files. No implementation code is written during scouting.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the pathfinder:scouting skill to write failing tests for all checkpoints."

## Prerequisites

- `.pathfinder/state.json` exists with `phases.plan.status === "approved"`
- Task files exist in `.pathfinder/tasks/`
- All tasks have `status: "planned"`

<HARD-GATE>
If plan is not approved, REFUSE to scout. Invoke pathfinder:planning first.
Do NOT write any implementation code during scouting. Tests ONLY.
</HARD-GATE>

## The Process

### Step 1: Read All Task Files

```bash
for f in .pathfinder/tasks/*.json; do
  echo "=== $(basename $f) ==="
  cat "$f"
done
```

### Step 2: For Each Checkpoint (in dependency order)

Follow `superpowers:test-driven-development` RED phase:

1. **Write the e2e test** — Playwright/Maestro/Cypress test that verifies the checkpoint
2. **Write the unit test** — Co-located unit tests for the logic
3. **Run tests to verify they FAIL:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --grep "<CHECKPOINT-ID>" --reporter=list
   # or
   npx vitest run --testNamePattern "<CHECKPOINT-ID>"
   ```
4. **Verify the failure is correct** — should fail because feature doesn't exist, NOT because of typos or test bugs

### Step 3: Capture Evidence in Task File

After confirming tests fail correctly:

```python
import json
task = json.load(open('.pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json'))
task['status'] = 'red'
task['tests'] = {
    'e2e': ['e2e/feature.spec.ts'],
    'unit': ['src/utils/feature.test.ts']
}
task['evidence']['red'] = {
    'e2e': 'FAIL e2e/feature.spec.ts > FEAT-01 (timeout waiting for locator)',
    'unit': 'FAIL src/utils/feature.test.ts > FEAT-01 (expected undefined)',
    'timestamp': '<ISO-8601>'
}
json.dump(task, open('.pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json', 'w'), indent=2)
```

### Step 4: Commit After Each Checkpoint's Tests

```bash
git add e2e/ src/**/*.test.* .pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-01.json
git commit -m "Scout: Mark trail for FEAT-01"
```

### Step 5: Create Scout Gate

After ALL checkpoints have tests:

```bash
cat > .pathfinder/scout.json << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>",
  "expedition": "<expedition-name>",
  "checkpointsScounted": <number>,
  "allTestsFail": true
}
EOF
```

### Step 6: Update State

```python
import json
state = json.load(open('.pathfinder/state.json'))
state['currentPhase'] = 'scout'
state['phases']['scout'] = {'status': 'complete', 'timestamp': '<ISO-8601>'}
state['checkpoints']['planned'] = 0
state['checkpoints']['red'] = state['checkpoints']['total']
json.dump(state, open('.pathfinder/state.json', 'w'), indent=2)
```

### Step 7: Final Verification

Run ALL tests together to confirm they all fail:

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=list
npx vitest run
```

Commit the scout gate:

```bash
git add .pathfinder/scout.json .pathfinder/state.json
git commit -m "Scout: All N checkpoints marked (RED)"
```

### Step 8: Transition to Building

Announce: "Scouting complete. N checkpoints marked with failing tests. Ready for building — invoke `pathfinder:building` or say `/build`."

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Writing implementation code during scouting | Tests only — implementation comes in build phase |
| Tests that pass without implementation | Tests must FAIL — they test features that don't exist yet |
| Skipping unit tests, only writing e2e | Both e2e AND unit tests for each checkpoint |
| Not running tests to verify failure | Always run and capture the failure output |
| Writing all tests then committing once | Commit after each checkpoint's tests |

## Output

- Test files for every checkpoint (e2e + unit)
- `.pathfinder/tasks/FEAT-XX.json` — all updated to `status: "red"` with failure evidence
- `.pathfinder/scout.json` — gate file
- Updated `.pathfinder/state.json`
